## About

Hi, my name is CJ. I work as a securirty consultant in financial services. I enjoy playing CTFs and writing up challenges. I also enjoy learning new things and sharing my knowledge with others. I've was lucky to be granted the Community Hero role in Blue Team Labs Online and previously reached rank 1 in the world. With my CTF Team BlueWithNoClue we also finished 47th in the 2023 Huntress CTF.

This repo hosts the code for my blog and portfolio.

** This is a fork from WhatATheme **

I've updated this to suit my own style and remove some components that we're required.
